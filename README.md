## Contributions

The Big Crunch is currently in its Alpha stage of development. There is much to be done to move it forward. Contributions of any form are greatfully accepted. Documentation updates, new library functions, bug fixes, features requests, comments of encouragement, etc. Please browse our GitHub repos and submit issues or pull requests.

## Open Source Approach

As much of what is created by the big crunch that can be open sourced, will be opened sourced. This is especially true for all the SDKs and formula functions.

The source code for the big crunch system itself will not be open sourced. The only reason being the value of the crunch comes because there is only one. A single place where all the information lives, is arranged and currated, and can be discovered and linked to. If others can easily launch other big crunches, that undermines its value.

## Philosophy

The Big Crunch has been designed with following manifesto driving every decision:

| The Big Manifesto                                          |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value Creation Is Everything                               |
| Information Should be Linked - Links Should Be Transparent |
| All Changes Should Propagate in Real Time                  |
| The Internet Has A Lot More To Give                        |
| Advertising Undermines Autheneticity                       |
| Your Information is Your Information                       |
| No Dark Patterns                                           |

## Numbers On The Internet Are Second Class Citizens

The Big Crunch was conceived based on the following drivers:

* Online information is hard to find
* Once found the information is hard to use
* Most information is built upon other information - but thats never clear
* When a piece of information changes, those using it are not informed
* Hence most published information never changes and is out of date
*
