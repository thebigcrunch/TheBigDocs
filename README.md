| The Big Manifesto                                          |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value Creation Is Everything                               |

| The Internet Has A Lot More To Give                        |
| Advertising Undermines Autheneticity                       |
| Your Information is Your Information                       |
| No Dark Patterns                                           |

## Numbers On The Internet Are Dead

The Big Crunch was conceived based on the following drivers:

* Information is hard to find
* Once found information is hard to use
* Most information is built upon other information - but thats never clear
* When information changes, no one knows, and its doesn't propagate
* Most published information never changes
* Hence most published information is out of date
