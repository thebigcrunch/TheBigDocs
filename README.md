### Numbers On The Internet Are Dead

The Big Crunch was conceived based on the following drivers:

* Information online is hard to find
* Once found information is hard to use
* A large amount of information is built upon other information
* The assumptions built into data are rarely exposed
* When information changes, notifications are rare
* Most published information never changes
* Ergo most published information is out of date
* Most smart people cannot publish information to the internet
