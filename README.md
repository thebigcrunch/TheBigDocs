### Numbers On The Internet Are Dead

The Big Crunch was conceived based on the following drivers:

* Information online is hard to find
* Once found information is hard to use
* Much information is built upon other information - but that is not obvious
* When information changes, notifications are rare and propagation is non-existant
* Most published information never changes
* Ergo most published information is out of date
